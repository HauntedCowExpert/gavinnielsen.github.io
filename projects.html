    <h3>Sales Tax Calulator</h3>

    <p>This program calulates the state sales tax for 49 states, excluding Hawaii. It adds only the state sales tax, and no county or city sales tax.<br>

    <p>Completed in 2021</p>
    <p>This game was made with python for an English Class project, and was based on The Crucible. <br> <br>
