            <h2>The Bill of Rights - The Original</h2>
            <h4>Richard Jacobson</h4>
            <p>
                The English Bill of Rights was passed by the Parliament in 1689 after the English Civil Wars (1642-1651) unlike other civil wars the English Civil was fought not over who should rule but how should they rule. The first two of the wars lasting (1642-1646) and (1648-1649) were supporters of King Charles I fought against supporters of the Long Parliament. The third civil war was between the supporters of King Charles II and supporters of the Rump Parliament a continuation of the Long Parliament. The war ended on September, 3rd, 1651 with a Parliament victory over the royalists. The aftermath of the civil wars left England without a monarch where Parliament ruled until the 1660 Restoration when King Charles II came back from exile and issued the Declaration of Breda which pardoned crimes committed during the British Civil Wars for anyone who saw him as the rightful and lawful King of England. Let’s jump to King James who came into power in 1685 with overwhelming support from both the Whigs and Tories because he was predictable and stable something the people of England wanted after the turmoil of the past and ruled until he undermined his supporters because he attempted to rule by decree and form a “King’s party” of Catholic and English Dissenters. King James was replaced in the Glorious Revolution of 1688, the revolution was quick and mostly peaceful, William of Orange and his wife Mary took over after James during the revolution. William of orange passed the Declaration of Rights or Bill of Rights 1689. The English Bill of Rights went over the miss deeds of King James along with Confirmation that William of Orange and his wife Mary were rightful successors to the throne of England, Thirteen clauses that limited the power of the Crown, which were 1. The power of executing laws belong to parliament, 2. The Crown does not have the power to execute laws, 3. The establishment of any Catholic Church is illegal, 4. The Crown can not tax without the permission of parliament, 5. Citizens have the right to petition the king without fear of repercussions, 6. A standing army at peacetime without the consent of parliament is illegal, 7. All Protestants have the right to bear arms for defense, 8. Parliament should be freely elected, 9. Members of Parliament have the freedom of speech and their proceedings should not be questioned outside of parliament, 10. Vail fees and unusual punishments are illegal, 11. All trials now require the presence of jurors and all jurors for trials of high treason must be landowners, 12. It is illegal to fine or seizes the property of any person who has not been convicted and all previous fines and seizures are void, 13. Parliament should be held frequently to uphold the laws. In general, the Bill of Rights limited the power of the monarchy, elevated the status of Parliament, and outlined certain rights of the individual. The English Bill of Rights influenced John Locke when he was creating the American Bill of Rights. Locke proposed that the role of the government is to protect its citizens’ natural rights instead of stripping them away <br><br>

            <h2>The War on Britain, by Britain</h2>
            <h4>Gavin Nielsen</h4>
            <p>
                During a feud with Pope Innocent III that began in 1208 King John became the first English sovereign to receive the punishment of excommunication. King John was also embarrassed during a military defeat in France during 1213, and was forced to attempt to rebuild his reputation, which he chose to do by demanding scutage from the barons who had not joined him. <br><br>

                During early 1215 baron Robert FitzWalter led the rebels in a civil war and managed to gain control of London. Realizing he had no power to fight and win over the rebels King John yielded and on June 15, 1215 he accepted the terms of the Articles of Barons at Runnymede. After four days of further modifications the Barons issued a formal version of the document which became known as the Magna Carta.<br><br>

                The Magna Carta was intended as a peace treaty, but failed and civil war broke out again within three months. After King John’s death his 9 year old successor advisors were forced to revisit the Magna Carta and decide which clauses to remove to avoid further conflict. The Magna Carta was reissued in 1217 and again in 1225 with further changes made, and each following version came after the “final” version of the Magna Carta issued in 1225.<br><br>

                The Magna Carta was the first written constitution in European history, and contained 63 clauses, many concerning the property rights of barons and other powerful citizens, and suggested limitations for the farmers. In 1776 American colonists looked towards the Magna Carta as a starting point and model for their ideas and demands of liberty and freedom from the English Crown. The Magna Carta forever lives on not only in British law but also in American law, reflected in both the Bill of Rights and the U.S. Constitution, especially shown in the fifth amendment, “Nor shall any persons be deprived of life, liberty or property without due process of law”, which echoes Clause 39.<br><br>

                Both the Magna Carta and the American Bill of Rights solved a common problem with the English Royalty. English Royalty only looked upon the barons and elite citizens for help and guidance, ignoring the lower classes of people unless requiring food or money. Eventually the lower classes as well as the barons became enraged with the King’s treatment of them, they attempted to negotiate with the King, but were led to rebellion and civil war.<br><br>

                After the King realized that the barons and citizens were not going to follow blindly as he hurt them for his own gain and the rebels took control of London, he once again began to negotiate, and the original Magna Carta was born. The American colonists took a similar approach and waged war against Britain, a war nobody thought could be won, and forced the King to negotiate to find peace and end a costly war that could not be won.<br><br>

                In essence the Magna Carta helped to pave the way for freedoms that both Americans and British know today, as well as the better freedoms our ancestors were able to have.<br><br>

            <h2>Petition of Rights</h2>
            <h4>Tristen Simonsen</h4>
            <p>
                The Petition of Right, passed on 7 June 1628, is an English constitutional document setting out specific individual protections against the state, reportedly of equal value to Magna Carta and the Bill of Rights in 1689. <br><br>

                It was part of a wider conflict between Parliament and the Stuart monarchy that led to the 1638 to 1651 Wars of the Three Kingdoms, ultimately resolved in the 1688 Glorious Revolution. <br><br>

                The Petition of Right of 1628 was an English document that helped promote the civil rights of the subjects of King Charles I. <br><br>

                Petition of Right, 1628, a statement of civil liberties sent by the English Parliament to Charles I . Refusal by Parliament to finance the king's unpopular foreign policy had caused his government to exact forced loans and to quarter troops in subjects' houses as an economy measure. <br><br>

                The Petition of Right was drawn up by Charles’s third Parliament in as many years. He had maintained a tumultuous relationship with the House of Commons, which did not trust Charles and denied him taxes to finance his war against Spain.<br><br>

                After dismissing his second Parliament, he became the latest monarch to impose a forced loan, an effective tax wherein the monarch compelled gifts from his subjects and imprisoned those who did not comply.<br><br>

                The Petition of Right, initiated by Sir Edward Coke , was based upon earlier statutes and charters and asserted four principles: no taxes may be levied without consent of Parliament; no subject may be imprisoned without cause shown, no soldiers may be quartered upon the citizenry, and martial law may not be used in time of peace. <br><br>

                In return for his acceptance, Charles was granted subsidies. Although the petition was of importance as a safeguard of civil liberties, its spirit was soon violated by Charles, who continued to collect tonnage and poundage duties without Parliament's authorization and to prosecute citizens in an arbitrary manner.<br><br>
