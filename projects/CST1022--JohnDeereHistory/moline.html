        <h1>Moline Factory</h1>
        <p>John Deere moved his business to Moline Illinois in 1848 due to the availability of water, power, and transportation in order to grow his business. <br>
            In 1887 the Deere and Mansur Company was formed by Charles Deere and Alvah Mansur, soon becoming a top manufacturer of planters. Due to the success of the business, Deere and Mansur moved from a two-story building to a larger factory to increase production following increased sales. <br>
            Under the leadership of William Butterworth in 1913, John Deere began building harvesters in a new factory, John Deere Harvester Works, which still produces John Deere equipment. <br>
            While growing in Moline, John Deere also purchased the Waterloo Gas Engine Company in 1918 to enter the tractor business, and sold 5,634 tractors in it's first year.
