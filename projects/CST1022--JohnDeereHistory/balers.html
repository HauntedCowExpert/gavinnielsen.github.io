        <p>
            <b>1881</b> Joseph Dain left his furniture business to focus his time on developing hay equipment.<br>
            <b>1882</b> Dain recieved his first patent and started manufacturing hay equipment. His products included an inclined stacker and a sweep rake. <br>
            <b>1890</b> Dain introduced a hay gatherer that was popular with small farms that couldn't justify the purchase of a stacker. <br>
            <b>1900</b> Dain Manufacturing moced to a 10 acre location in Ottumwa, Iowa. The location was near multiple railways, making shipping easier. Dain also sold his equipment to John Deere dealers during this time. <br>
            <b>1905</b> Dain formed an agreement with John Deere giving them exclsive rights to sell Dain hay equipment. <br>
            <b>1910</b> John Deere purchased Dain Manufacturing, which was producing mower, rakes, hay loaders, hay presses, and more. <br>
            <b>1955</b> John Deere introduces the 14T baler, eliminating 50% of the labor required to bale. <br>
            <b>1956</b> John Deere releases the No. 10 Rotary Chopper, allowing farmers to cut sugar-beet tops for silage, along with legume hay, dry hay, and straw. <br>
            <b>1961</b> Ottumwa Works continued to develop and manufacture new equipment, producing 21 different models of hay equipment by this time.
            <b>Present</b> John Deere Ottumwa Works is still the main manufacturing plant of John Deere hay equipment.
